A mongo backend, along with a cloudinary back-end for images, run with an express node.js builds this fullstack server-side rendered application. Authorized users can add their dogs and edit, while non-authorized users still have access to rate dogs. There is also an option to decide who has the **best** best-friend through a head to head wag-tag option. Two dogs are paired off against each other and whichever is tagged, gets a higher ranking.
